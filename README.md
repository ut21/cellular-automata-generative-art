# Cellular automata generative art
 A python implementation of a modified Conway's game of life algorithm to generate cool visuals
# Background and further reading
I've been interested in doing "generative art" for some time now, and this is my first foray into the field(the last repo i uploaded was sort of generative art but wasnt algorithmic or mathematically interesting at all. I had just happened to luck onto some transformations that worked well).
I first came across cellular automata on www.fronkonstin.com which is an immensly goated site. I plan to implement more algorithms from there.

# Further work
  * Currently the code is optimisied for readability and not performance. Hopefully soon enough I will have the motivation to upload the vectorised code also
  * The current definition of neighborhood is quite primitive, I want to try out how the plot reacts to different neighborhood definitions. (for more information, refer to www.fronkonstin.com)
  * Primitive updation condition, want to see what else is possible
  * implement the classic Conway's Game of Life
